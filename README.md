<p align="center"> <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xUPGcguWZHRC2HyBRS/giphy.gif" width="300"/> </p>

A Machine Learning–based intelligent system to support Indian farmers with smart crop recommendations and yield prediction.

📌 Project Overview

Agriculture is the backbone of India, yet crop selection and yield estimation are often based on experience rather than data.
This project leverages Machine Learning and Data Science to help farmers make data-driven decisions by:

🌱 Recommending the most suitable crop

📈 Predicting expected crop yield

🌦️ Using soil nutrients, weather conditions & season

🎯 Objectives

✅ Recommend the best crop based on soil & climate parameters

✅ Predict crop yield accurately

✅ Provide a user-friendly web interface

✅ Support sustainable and smart agriculture

🧠 How It Works
